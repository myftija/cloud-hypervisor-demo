"""
A demo script for visualising on-host microVM network activity.

Will read bytes recieved by the host on microVM tun/tap devices, as per
`/proc/net/dev` file, and then use that data to color a cell on the terminal.

The terminal screen is refreshed periodically. The brigher a cell is colored,
the more bytes the host recieved from that microVM. The brightness range is
scaled based on the maximum amount of bytes a microvm has sent in that refresh
cycle.
